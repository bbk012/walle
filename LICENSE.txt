In this repository there are also files which comes from other authors, I made an attempt

Wall-e rely on uC/OS-II real time operating system (RTOS), I used old files I had from Jean J. Labrosse book
MicroC/OS-II: The Real Time Kernel (which included the code) extended by additional files needed to make operating 
system port to LPC2378 microcontroller.
According to Micrium who is uC/OS-II owner uC/OS is free for non-commercial use  (https://www.micrium.com/buy/licensing/).
Because that is definitely non-commercial use, hobby type project I placed those files in my project repository as well.
